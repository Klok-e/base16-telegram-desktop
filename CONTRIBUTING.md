Coding guidelines
-----------------

* Altough the code is kind of messy at the moment, please try to write clean, organized and well documented code.
* Please use `baseXY` variables when setting a color.

Tips for a good bug report
--------------------------

* Help us help you! The more details you give, the better we'll be able to
help you out.
* Please add a screenshot describing your problem.


Tips for writing a good feature request
---------------------------------------

* Describe your problem and where exactly it occured.
* Please describe also your desired solution carefully.
* Please add a screenshot describing your whishes.


Tips for writing good pull requests
-----------------------------------

* The first line should be a short (50 characters or less) summary of your
commit message. If you can't find a short enough one-line summary, split the
commit into multiple ones.
* Keep one line between the one-line summary and the body.
* Use bullet points in the body of the commit message to separate multiple
things you did.
* Your commits should be clear and concise. That means also you shouldn't sum
up two features or two bug fixes into one commit. If you do, it makes both
bug fixes and features harder to understand. Also, don't hesitate to
[rewrite](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) the
Github history of your development branch.
* Wrap the body of the commit message at around 80 characters.
* If your commit addresses a particular PR, commit or issue, please say so in
your commit. The Github documentation
([1](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/)
 and [2](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/))
can help you with that.
* Please add a screenshot describing the state before and after your changes.

Thank you for your help!
